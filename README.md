**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

### Originally: 7d2dModlets
Originally Forked from Khelldons original 7d2dModlets for alpha17 "7 Days to Die" modlets to work with later game versions.
Note: Should anyone, The Fun Pimps, etc wonder, Khelldon gave permission to use/update these as needed, per https://7daystodie.com personal communications. I plan on trying to keep these up to date and close to original purpose/functionality as much as I reasonably can.

**To install game mods**: [7 Days to Die modlet installation](https://gist.github.com/doughphunghus/a1907c5f63b5fe79bd823965328f25bf)

#### Doughphunghus's fork - a18 General updates notes:
Mods were originally written for a17, updated them for a18, mostly by:
- Adding/migrating Localization.txt
- Adding/modifying Readme.md to indicate a18 support
- Modifying ModInfo.xml to change version number to  differentiate it from originals.
  - Bumped version to 2.0.0 when mod is no longer compatible with a17
  - Added "-doughphunghus" to version number to indicate the modlet comes from this fork
- Migrating existing icons
- Adding display values for item statistics
- Updating xpath when needed
- Not all mods had Localization info or may have missing icons.  Please submit an issue if you find one.
- Mods that modify the "UI" were not converted so they may not work. Please submit an issue if you find one.
