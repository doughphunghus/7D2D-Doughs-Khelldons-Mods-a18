# Frames that needs nails
This changes wood frames so they need to be stacked and nailed together when building.
Note: Changed Original modlet to be able to attach a single frame on the side of a block.
Previously you could only put blocks on top of each other.

Details:
- Need to have nails to upgrade wood frames
- Wood frames can only be built out horizontally 1 block before collapsing.
  To avoid collapsing, upgrade to wood block.
