# Get Greener!
This modlet removes the snow and desert biomes from the game and adds more forest.

Details:
- snow and desert are just replaced with the standard pine forest biome.
- Oil shale is added to pine forest biome that replaced desert.
- Can only be used when generating a new world.
- World generation UI is modified so you can see the biomes (colored) properly
